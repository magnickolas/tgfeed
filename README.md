# tgfeed

Tool for [Telegram][tg] to create feeds from lists of chats.

## Main features

- Collect posts from multiple channels in an RSS manner and publish them to a single one
- Optionally filter out posts that are suspicious of advertisements

## Quickstart

### Prepare your first feed

Create a folder with a name starting with \* (e.g. \*cats_memes)
and put all the channels to collect posts from in it.

### Install the application

The app requires at least Python 3.9

```console
pip install tgfeed
```

### Get API id

One should follow [an instruction][tg_api] to obtain a developer API id.

### Run

```console
# Sample app_id and app_hash, you should normally use your own
export APP_ID=611335 APP_HASH=d524b414d21f4d37f08684c1df41ac9c
python -m tgfeed
```

The first time you run the app, you'll be prompted to type in your phone number,
verification code and cloud password if applicable.

The tool will create a private channel with the folder's name
(it can be changed manually later) and periodically forward new posts to it.

### Daemonizing

As the application needs to be continuously run, it is recommended
to use some tooling in order to create a background daemon,
e.g. a systemd service:

```
[Unit]
Description=tgfeed
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0
StartLimitBurst=10

[Service]
Restart=on-failure
ExecStart=python3 -m tgfeed
# Sample app_id and app_hash, you should normally use your own
Environment="APP_ID=611335"
Environment="APP_HASH=d524b414d21f4d37f08684c1df41ac9c"
# ... other env vars ...

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

## Running from source

1. Install [uv][uv]
2. Install dependencies into a virtual environment:
   ```console
   uv sync
   ```
3. Run the application using:
   ```console
   uv run python -m tgfeed
   ```
